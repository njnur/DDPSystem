# Distributed Data Processing System in Go

## Description

This project aims to design and implement a Distributed Data Processing System in Go, focusing on ingesting, processing, and analyzing large datasets in real-time. It simulates big data analytics and streaming platforms, handling concurrent data streams, distributed computing, and real-time data processing. The system is built with scalability, performance, and efficiency in mind, leveraging Go's concurrency model, distributed system principles, and data processing algorithms.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.22 or higher)
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Prometheus and Grafana (for monitoring)

## Project Roadmap

#### Task 1: Setting Up and Hello World
- **Objective**: Familiarize yourself with the Go environment and toolchain.
- **Task**: Install Go, set up your workspace, and write a "Hello, World!" program.

#### Task 2: Go Basics Revisited
- **Objective**: Get comfortable with Go syntax and idiomatic constructs.
- **Task**: Implement basic data structures (linked list, hash map) from scratch, focusing on Go's type system, pointers, and interfaces.

#### Task 3: Concurrent Web Crawler
- **Objective**: Understand Go's concurrency model through a practical application.
- **Task**: Build a concurrent web crawler that fetches data from multiple URLs simultaneously using goroutines and channels.

#### Task 4: HTTP Server and Client Interaction
- **Objective**: Learn to handle HTTP requests and responses in Go.
- **Task**: Develop a simple HTTP server and client. The server should accept data payloads, and the client should send concurrent requests to the server.

#### Task 5: Implementing a Basic Data Processing Pipeline
- **Objective**: Lay the foundation for data ingestion and processing.
- **Task**: Create a pipeline that ingests data from HTTP requests, processes the data (e.g., filtering, aggregation), and stores it in memory. Use goroutines and channels for asynchronous processing.

#### Task 6: Distributed Systems Fundamentals
- **Objective**: Explore the basics of distributed computing.
- **Task**: Extend the data processing pipeline to distribute tasks across multiple nodes (can simulate with different processes or Docker containers). Implement basic communication using RPC or HTTP.

#### Task 7: Scalable Storage with Distributed Databases
- **Objective**: Learn about scalable data storage solutions.
- **Task**: Integrate a distributed NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra, CockroachDB) for storing processed data. Focus on schema design and data partitioning strategies.

#### Task 8: Advanced Data Processing
- **Objective**: Implement complex data processing algorithms.
- **Task**: Add support for real-time data stream processing. Implement windowing, state management, and time-based aggregations.

#### Task 9: Observability and Monitoring
- **Objective**: Understand the importance of observability in distributed systems.
- **Task**: Integrate logging, metrics collection, and tracing in your system. Use open-source tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

#### Task 10: Deployment and Scalability Challenges
- **Objective**: Tackle deployment and scalability issues.
- **Task**: Containerize your application using Docker. Write Kubernetes manifests for deployment, ensuring your system can scale up based on load. Implement a load balancer to distribute incoming requests.

#### Task 11: Performance Optimization and Benchmarking
- **Objective**: Optimize your system for performance.
- **Task**: Profile your application and identify bottlenecks. Optimize performance using techniques like batching, tuning garbage collection, and optimizing data structures. Implement benchmarks to measure improvements.

#### Task 12: Final Touches and Documentation
- **Objective**: Prepare your project for open-source release.
- **Task**: Write comprehensive documentation, including setup guides, API references, and architecture diagrams. Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality.
